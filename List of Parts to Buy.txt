Total Estimated Cost (Excluding Shipping)
Previous Estimate: ~$105.72

Updated Estimate: ~$109.42
The increase is due to slight price differences in the new alternatives (e.g., FS90R servo at $4.50 instead of $3.99, PETG filament at $20.99 instead of $19.99). This remains a reasonable budget for the project.

Notes on Purchasing
Link Verification: All links were tested and confirmed functional on May 19, 2025. However, availability can change quickly on platforms like Amazon, so I recommend ordering soon or searching for similar items if a link becomes unavailable.

Shipping Costs: The total excludes shipping, which varies by seller and location. Consolidate purchases where possible to minimize fees.

Compatibility: All alternatives were chosen to match the original specifications (e.g., 5V operation for servos, food-safe materials for the jar, tubing, and filament).

Next Steps
Order the Parts: Use the updated links to purchase the components. Verify availability at the time of purchase.

Print the 3D Parts: Use the food-safe PETG filament to print the parts (starter jar lid, trapdoor, waste container, flour hopper, hopper lid, auger, impeller, load cell platform, electronics enclosure, enclosure lid, and frame) using the OpenSCAD scripts provided earlier.

Assemble the Machine: Follow the assembly instructions provided previously to build the machine, integrating the purchased components with the 3D-printed parts.

Test the System: Run a feeding cycle to ensure the auger dispenses flour, the pump delivers water, and the impeller mixes the starter.
