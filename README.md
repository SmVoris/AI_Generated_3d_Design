For this project I asked xAI to help me design, and create a machine to automate the process of feeding my wife's sourdough starter.

My design parameters were that this be done in such a way that parts of the machine could be FDM 3d printed.  The other main parameter that I gave was that we use a small, inexpensive micro controller, like a raspberry pi pico.

The first response was pretty good, and offered suggested improvements of upgrading to the raspberry pi pico W to gain wi-fi capabilites, it also suggest the addition of a load cell sensor, and a heating pad to maintain the best possible conditons for the sourdough.
This upgraded design with enhanced capabilities is what I asked Grok to move forward on.  

Grok provied a detailed list, and description of the parts for the machine that needed to be 3d printed.  However Grok was unable to provide an STL, or 3d object file suitable for 3d printing.
Shifting course I asked Grok if there was a way to take it's specific instructions and convert directly to a 3d object.  So Grok offered OpenSCAD, to which I promptly downloaded, and installed.

Sure enough feeding Groks instructions for each part, which I had asked it to taylor specifically to OpenSCAD, I began getting STL files that I could feed to my Slider, and then on to my 3d Printer.  Several parts rendered flawlessly.  
The Auger however did give us quite a bit of difficulty.  Grok and I went back and forth 8 or 9 times trying to get the central shaft of the auger to render the full length of the auger, which Grok assured me was the intended design.

Grok also suggested it was a rendering error in OpenSCAD, so I took a few of the output STLs and loaded in Cura to render a preview there.  Same result.  
The auger will most likely need to be revisited, but I decided to move forward with printing a few of the parts so that I could begein testing fitment of the design.  

This Repository also contains a Python Script, provided by Grok for the control of the machine, via the Raspberry Pi Pico W.  

Moving on I also asked Grok to provide some rendered images of the assembled machine.  The first couple of attempts were very busy with wires, so I asked it to remove them.  
The next iteration was overun by circuit boards, so I asked for another, this time with the electronics removed.  These are the included images of the machine.

I also asked Grok to provide me with both detailed Printing Instructions, including its recommended print settings, as well as Assembly instructions.  The output of both is in the txt files in this repository.
